# 👋Hey there! Alexey Glazkov is here. 👨‍💻

I am a Frontend Software Developer from Ukraine. I ama big fan of technologies and love to learn new things. My everyday personal challange is to learn something new or practice the things I need in my professional path.

## 🔭 About me

💡I’ve always been a great problem solver, an independent introvert and a "progressive googler", which literally helps a lot in my daily routines. Today, I’m working from home as a software engineer for Platosolutions, Inc., and I get to show off all these elements of who I am.  
  
🎓I started learning to code when I was a teenager, though it was always more of a hobby than a career focus. I spent days digging into the technologies trying to learn something new and create something incredible and useful. After a school education I entered the university for the Software Engineering major, and even though University provided a bunch of capabilities and work, programming still persists as my hobby. I realized software engineering was the right field for me.  
  
🧑‍🎓During my university years I worked as an independent freelancer and later on I participated in small startups, which helped my to enhance my skills. Currently I'm working at Platosolutions, Inc., where I grow as an engineer, provide a solutions to the problems and architect a business-level solutions.  
  
👨‍💻During the work, I realized that no matter how much code you wrote and no matter how fast you closed your feature ticket in the tracker if the solution is not good enough. The most important thing is always think about the solution first. Be an engineer and not a coder. Anyone can code, but you don't need to be anyone. You need to be the one who architects a solution first with a clear mind and after you feel confident about it - start the process.  
  
📚I never stop learning and always have a desire to explore new technologies. At the same time, I qualitatively analyze the studied technologies and put into practice only those that can really bring benefits to the project.
